<strong>Incremental search</strong>
<p>Incremental search allows users to find one of the countries on earth. Every time the user types a visible character, if the current value of the input field is at the beginning of the names of any countries in the list, those country names are displayed (limited to four countries displayed at a time).
If a list of results is displayed and the user clicks outside of it and outside of the input field, the result list disappears. If the user mouses over a result in the result list, that result lights up. The same happens with arrow up and down keyes.
If the user clicks a result or hits the enter key while a result is lit up, the full country name of the appropriate result appears in the input field and the result list disappears.</p>
